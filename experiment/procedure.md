## Experimental Setup

![experimental setup](./images/fig5.png)

## Procedure

The experimental setup is shown in Figure (5). Complete the assembly as sketched in figure (5a). Connect a 60W incandescent light bulb to the variac through an ammeter (digital mulimetrer) in series. A digital voltmeter is also connected in parallel to measure voltage values. The variac is an AC transformer that gives variable voltages.

**Note: Make sure the variac is unplugged when you are making electrical connections. Wear safety gloves. Remember, never touch bare electric wires.**

You are provided with a cylindrical tube with bulb fitted inside it. Inert this cylindrical tube into the black box. Fix the bulb position as shown in Figure (5c). Now assemble the optical components in a way shown in Figure (5d) and connect the silicon photodiode to digital oscilloscope.
